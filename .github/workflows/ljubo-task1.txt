Here are the projects that I would like you to look at:

https://github.com/G-Research/ParquetSharp
https://github.com/G-Research/consuldotnet
https://github.com/m4rs-mt/ILGPU
https://github.com/m4rs-mt/ILGPU.Algorithms

I would like you to familiarise yourself with their GitHub Actions workflows, 
understand what it takes to build them locally, to run their tests, how they are released, etc.
We will discuss on Wednesday what you found out, 
anything that would be unclear to you, or improvements that you would like to suggest.

The other tasks we discussed are:
- add dotnet-format support to ParquetSharp (automatic code formatting tool — the goal is to ensure that code formatting is always consistent between devs — have a look at consuldotnet to see how we've done it)
- make sure that the `deploy-gh-pages` job does not run when there is nothing to do on https://github.com/G-Research/armada
- also for armada, make sure that unit tests do not run for the `gh-pages` branch
